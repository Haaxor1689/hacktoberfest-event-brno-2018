# Hactoberfest Event Brno 2018

This repository is used to show beginners, how to contribute to the open source project in the Hacktpoberfest Event 2018 held 18/10/2018 in Brno in Kentico offices.

# Task
All you need to do is make an HTML file in the `Attendees` folder

## Html file?
Yes! Html file!
I bet you're wondering what it should have inside. 
That's the thing, I dont have many github friends, so I would like to know what you do on github.

I've got the best idea, make ***HTML FILES*** that have their username as the filename, for example 
`Simply0007.html`

***YOUR FILE NAME MUST BE YOUR GITHUB URL (ex: https://github.com/Simply007 -> Simply007.html)***

***Your GITHUB URL (ex: https://github.com/Simply007) MUST BE CLEARLY VISIBLE, ACCURATE, AND UNIQUE.***

## HTML File Rules
**Your HTML file can include *anything you want*, as long as it follows this ruleset:**
1. No Malicious Code (cookie sniffing, iframe hacking, css local file stealing, ios rootkits, while loops that never end, CPU Monero Miners)
2. No NSFW (porn, nudes, pictures of your cat's testicles, severed heads)
3. No ADS (No advertising your product, No having third party ads)
4. Only a single file may be added per GitHub account. That's one. O N E.

# Thanks

# What is hacktoberfest 
Hacktoberfest — brought to you by DigitalOcean in partnership with GitHub and Twilio — is a month-long celebration of open source software.  And it has one special evening of a great importance. Under the cloak of night, developers grab a glass of cold drink, put their heads together and resolve the most challenging issues. Maintainers are invited to guide would-be contributors towards issues that will help move the project forward, and contributors get the opportunity to give back to both projects they like, and ones they've just discovered. No contribution is too small—bug fixes and documentation updates are valid ways of participating. 

## Final Note
Remember to be friendly.
