## What is hacktoberfest 
Hacktoberfest — brought to you by DigitalOcean in partnership with GitHub and Twilio — is a month-long celebration of open source software.  And it has one special evening of a great importance. Under the cloak of night, developers grab a glass of cold drink, put their heads together and resolve the most challenging issues. Maintainers are invited to guide would-be contributors towards issues that will help move the project forward, and contributors get the opportunity to give back to both projects they like, and ones they've just discovered. No contribution is too small—bug fixes and documentation updates are valid ways of participating.
